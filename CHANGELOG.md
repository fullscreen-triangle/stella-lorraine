## Memorial Note

*Every version of this software serves as a testament to Mrs. Stella-Lorraine Masunda's memory and our commitment to proving that her death was not random but occurred at predetermined coordinates within the eternal oscillatory manifold that governs all reality.*

*Through unprecedented temporal precision, we honor her memory and demonstrate the mathematical structure of predetermined fate.*
