# CatScript Multi-Scale Frequency Analysis
# =========================================
# Validates trans-Planckian resolution across frequency scales

# Apply full enhancement chain first
enhance with all

# Molecular vibration scale (CO stretch)
# Frequency: 5.13e13 Hz
resolve time at 5.13e13 Hz

# Electronic transition scale (Lyman-alpha)
# Frequency: 2.47e15 Hz
resolve time at 2.47e15 Hz

# Nuclear scale (electron Compton frequency)
# Frequency: 1.24e20 Hz
resolve time at 1.24e20 Hz

# Planck frequency
# Frequency: 1.855e43 Hz
resolve time at 1.855e43 Hz

# Schwarzschild frequency (electron)
# Frequency: 1.35e53 Hz
resolve time at 1.35e53 Hz

# Summary: All frequencies should show trans-Planckian resolution
# Scaling law: δt ∝ ν⁻¹ with slope = -1.000
