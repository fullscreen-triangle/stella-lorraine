# CatScript Basic Demo
# ====================
# Demonstrates core functionality of the categorical state counting language

# 1. TEMPORAL RESOLUTION
# Calculate trans-Planckian resolution at molecular vibration frequency
resolve time at 5.13e13 Hz

# 2. ENTROPY CALCULATION
# Calculate entropy using triple equivalence theorem
# S = k_B × M × ln(n)
entropy of 3 oscillators with 4 states

# 3. ENHANCEMENT CHAIN
# Apply all five enhancement mechanisms
# Total: 10^(3.5 + 5 + 3 + 66 + 43.4) = 10^120.95
enhance with all

# 4. SPECTROSCOPY VALIDATION
# Measure Raman spectrum of vanillin
spectrum raman of vanillin

# 5. TEMPERATURE SIMULATION
# Simulate approach to heat death
temperature from 300K to 1e-15K steps 50

# 6. RUN VALIDATION
validate all
