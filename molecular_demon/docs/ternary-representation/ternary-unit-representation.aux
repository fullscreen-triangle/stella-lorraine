Dashed lines (blue, green, red) connect original point to projections, showing orthogonal decomposition. Projection operation π$_i$(T) extracts every third trit from string T starting at position i: π$_0$(T) yields Sk coordinate, π$_1$(T) yields St, π$_2$(T) yields Se. Geometric interpretation: projection collapses 3D trajectory onto 1D axis, recovering coordinate value from trit sequence. Inverse operation (composition) reconstructs 3D point from three 1D projections. \textbf  {(Top Right)} Completion operation for categorical finalization.

Blue circle (filled) at St=0.5 represents intermediate position after two trits.

Each trit acts as navigation instruction: value 0 means "go to lower third of next axis," value 1 means "go to middle third," value 2 means "go to upper third." Cyclic axis ordering (Sk→St→Se→Sk...) determines which coordinate each trit refines.

Annotation box: "Geodesic distance: 0.849, Manhattan distance: 1.200, Ratio: 1.414" confirms $\sqrt  {2}$ ratio between Euclidean and Manhattan metrics in 2D. Ternary encoding naturally produces Manhattan paths (axis-aligned steps) because each trit refines one coordinate. Geodesic paths require interleaved trit sequences (alternating between axes), while non-geodesic paths use blocked sequences (all trits for one axis, then next axis). Path complexity measured by number of axis switches: geodesic requires k switches for k trits, blocked path requires 2 switches regardless of k. \textbf  {(Bottom Right)} Path length distribution for random trit sequences. Blue horizontal line with error bars: average Manhattan distance vs depth k for 1000 random trit sequences.

Black dashed line: Theoretical Bound $D_{max}(k) = \sqrt {3} \cdot 3^{-k}$. All trajectories follow exponential decay $D(k) \approx D_0 \cdot 3^{-k}$ with rate $\lambda = \ln (3) \approx 1.099$, independent of target location. \textbf {(Row 3, Right)} Information density comparison: Binary $2^k$ (blue circles) versus Ternary $3^k$ (red squares). X-axis: Digit Count $k$ (2 to 10). Y-axis: Encoded Values (log scale $10^1$ to $10^4$). Exponential divergence: at $k=2$, ratio $= 2.25$; at $k=6$, ratio $= 11.39$; at $k=10$, ratio $= 57.67$. Divergence follows $(3/2)^k$. \textbf {(Row 4, Left)} Trajectory distance preservation showing prefix-based proximity. X-axis: Common Prefix Length (0 to 4). Y-axis: Euclidean Distance in $S$-Space (0.0 to 1.2). Color indicates Hamming distance (yellow: 0-1, green: 2-4, cyan: 5-6, purple: 7-8). Points cluster along decreasing curves: $D_{Euclidean} \approx C \cdot 3^{-L_{prefix}}$. Longer prefixes correspond to smaller distances, enabling $O(\log _3 N)$ nearest-neighbor search. \textbf {(Row 4, Center)} S-entropy dynamics with ternary encoding. X-axis: Time (0 to 12). Y-axis: S-Entropy Coordinate (0.0 to 1.0). Three phase-shifted sinusoids: red ($S_k$), green ($S_t$), blue ($S_e$). Each follows $S_i(t) = 0.5 + 0.3\sin (\omega t + \phi _i)$ where $\omega = 2\pi /6$ and phase offsets $\phi _k = 0$, $\phi _t = 2\pi /3$, $\phi _e = 4\pi /3$. Sampling rate $f_s = 10$ samples/cycle maintains fidelity. \textbf {(Row 4, Right)} Tryte structure validation showing all 729 cells ($3^6$ combinations) in grid layout. X-axis: $S_k$ (0.2 to 1.0). Y-axis: $S_t$ (0.2 to 1.0). Each cell color-coded by $S_e$ (purple: low, yellow: high). Grid spacing $\Delta S = 1/27 \approx 0.037$ confirms uniform quantization. This validates 6 trits (2 per dimension) provide $27 \times 27 = 729$ cells with bijective mapping to $(S_k, S_t, S_e)$ space}{figure.6}{}}

Red curve: Phase 0° ($\phi _0 = 0$, Trit 0/Sk dimension), blue curve: Phase 120° ($\phi _1 = 2\pi /3$, Trit 1/St dimension), green curve: Phase 240° ($\phi _2 = 4\pi /3$, Trit 2/Se dimension). Waveforms follow $V_i(t) = A\sin (\omega t + \phi _i)$ where $A = 1V$ amplitude, $\omega = 2\pi f$ angular frequency, and $i \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ indexes the three phases. Horizontal arrow at $t=1$ radian shows 120° phase offset between red and green curves. The orthogonal phase relationship ensures unambiguous state discrimination: at any time instant, exactly one phase dominates, enabling reliable trit detection. Time axis spans 0 to 12 radians (approximately 2 complete cycles), demonstrating periodic repetition of the three-phase pattern. \textbf  {(Top Right)} 3D phase space representation showing ternary state vectors as geometric objects. Three colored markers indicate trit positions: red circle (Trit 0) at phase $\phi _0 = 0°$ on negative Phase 240° axis, green square (Trit 1) at phase $\phi _1 = 120°$ on positive Phase 120° axis, blue triangle (Trit 2) at phase $\phi _2 = 240°$ on positive Phase 240° axis. Green-yellow elliptical trajectory shows continuous evolution in 3D phase space, representing the vector $\vec  {V}(t) = (V_0(t), V_1(t), V_2(t))$ where components satisfy balanced three-phase constraint $V_0 + V_1 + V_2 = 0$. Axes labeled Phase 0° (Sk), Phase 120° (St), Phase 240° (Se) span $-1.00$ to $+1.00$ normalized units. The ellipse demonstrates that three-phase oscillators naturally encode ternary states through continuous rotation in 3D space, with discrete trit values corresponding to vertices of an equilateral triangle projected onto the unit sphere. \textbf  {(Bottom Left)} Voltage-based ternary gate circuit implementing three-level logic detection through threshold comparison. Yellow box (left): Input Voltage feeds into three-level comparator. Central green box: V\_mid (0V) $\rightarrow $ Trit 1 with threshold range $-0.5V < V_{in} < +0.5V$ (threshold: $-0.5V$ below, produces Trit 1 output). Top blue box: V\_high (+1V) $\rightarrow $ Trit 2 with threshold $V_{in} \geq +0.5V$ (threshold: $+0.5V$ above). Bottom red box: V\_low ($-1V$) $\rightarrow $ Trit 0 with threshold $V_{in} \leq -0.5V$ (threshold: $-0.5V$ below). Orange box (right): Output Trit represents detected ternary state. The circuit uses two voltage comparators with thresholds at $V_{th,1} = +0.5V$ and $V_{th,2} = -0.5V$ to discriminate between three logic levels, providing noise margins $\Delta V = 0.5V$ between adjacent states. This hardware implementation enables direct conversion from analog three-phase signals to digital trit values without binary intermediate representation. \textbf  {(Bottom Right)} Physical trit encoding showing temporal mapping from continuous oscillators to discrete trit detection zones.
