Figure 20: Quantum partition structure
Both figures now have comprehensive, publication-ready captions! 🎉

Figure 19 shows the power of S-transformation for dimensional reduction.

Figure 20 extends partition framework to quantum mechanics, showing its universal applicability beyond transport phenomena.
