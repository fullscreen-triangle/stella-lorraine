# this should produce a panel image tht uses a vibrational mode mapper, that is, the gas molecules are mapped onto hardware oscilllations  and their vibration trajectories are mapped 

# This script should have a section with the vibrational fields, a polar bar chart showing the phases of the different molecular vibrations 
# A 3d chart showing the trajectories of different molecular vibrations  and a a 2d scatter plot with partitions 



# aperture panel 
# A scatter plot showing particles passing through concentration gradient apertures
# A heatmap showing the changes in arpature 
#  A network chart showing size of arpeture 
# 3d chat showing the geometric properties of the arpeture
