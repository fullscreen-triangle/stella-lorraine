\begin{abstract}
We establish that oscillation, categorical distinction, and partition operation constitute three equivalent descriptions of a single mathematical structure. Any bounded dynamical system necessarily exhibits periodic behavior; this periodicity defines distinguishable states (categories) whose sequential traversal constitutes the oscillation; the temporal segments between states are partitions of the period. From this triple equivalence, we derive entropy in three mathematically identical forms: categorical $S = k_B M \ln n$, oscillatory $S = k_B \sum_i \ln(A_i/A_0)$, and partition-based $S = k_B \sum_a \ln(1/s_a)$, where $M$ denotes the number of categorical dimensions, $n$ the states per dimension, $A_i$ the oscillation amplitudes, and $s_a$ the partition selectivities.

We prove that all fundamental thermodynamic quantities—enthalpy, temperature, pressure, and internal energy—admit three equivalent formulations corresponding to the categorical, oscillatory, and partition perspectives, yielding identical physical predictions. The ideal gas law $PV = Nk_BT$ emerges as a categorical balance condition, with pressure as categorical density $P = k_BTM/V$, temperature as the rate of categorical actualisation $T = U/(k_BM)$, and internal energy as active category counting $U = M_{\text{active}}k_BT$. The Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution arises as the continuum limit of discrete categorical structure, naturally bounded by the speed of light without ad hoc relativistic corrections.

This framework resolves three longstanding conceptual difficulties in classical statistical mechanics: (i) the resolution-dependence of temperature in phase space discretization vanishes because categorical temperature $T = U/(k_BM)$ depends only on the number of active degrees of freedom, not on arbitrary bin sizes; (ii) pressure emerges as a bulk property (categorical density) rather than being localised at container boundaries; (iii) the unphysical infinite velocity tail of the Maxwell distribution is eliminated through the natural upper bound imposed by categorical discretization at $v = c$. Experimental validation through categorical memory implementation confirms thermodynamic predictions with mean deviations of 2.3\% for entropy, temperature, and pressure measurements.

All results derive from a single foundational premise: physical systems occupy finite domains. This boundedness necessitates the triple equivalence structure, from which statistical mechanics follows as a mathematical consequence rather than an empirical postulate.

\section{Introduction: The Structure of Bounded Systems}

\subsection{The Ubiquity of Bounds}

Every physical system occupies a finite domain. A gas is confined to a container. An electron is bound to an atom. A planet orbits within a gravitational well. A vibrating string is fixed at its endpoints. A digital oscillator cycles within a bounded frequency range. This boundedness is not incidental but fundamental: unbounded systems would require infinite energy, infinite extent, or both.

We take this observation as our starting point: \textit{physical systems are bounded}. From this single premise, we derive the complete structure of statistical mechanics.

\subsection{Bounded Dynamics Implies Oscillation}

Consider a system confined to a finite region of phase space. Let $\mathbf{x}(t)$ denote its trajectory. Since the accessible region is bounded, the trajectory cannot escape to infinity. By the Poincar\'e recurrence theorem~\cite{poincare1890}, the system must return arbitrarily close to any previous state given sufficient time.

More strongly, for systems with continuous dynamics in bounded domains, the trajectory must eventually reverse direction at the boundaries. This reversal, combined with time-translation invariance, implies periodic or quasi-periodic motion.

\begin{proposition}
\textit{Any bounded dynamical system with continuous evolution exhibits oscillatory behavior.}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Let the system occupy the domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with boundary $\partial\mathcal{D}$. For continuous dynamics, when the trajectory reaches $\partial\mathcal{D}$, it must either stop (equilibrium at the boundary) or reverse (reflection). If it stops, no further dynamics occur. If it reverses, the trajectory moves back into $\mathcal{D}$. By time-reversal symmetry of conservative dynamics, the return trajectory mirrors the outgoing trajectory. The system thus oscillates between boundary encounters.
\end{proof}

This is not a mathematical abstraction. A pendulum swings between turning points. Gas molecules bounce between container walls. Electrons orbit nuclei. Photons reflect between cavity mirrors. Clock signals oscillate between voltage levels. Oscillation is the universal signature of bounded dynamics.

\subsection{Oscillation Defines Categories}

An oscillating system traverses distinct states. Consider the pendulum: at each instant, it occupies a specific position $x$ with specific momentum $p$. The set of $(x, p)$ pairs visited during one period constitutes the oscillation's \textit{categorical structure}.

\begin{definition}
A \textit{category} is a distinguishable state of an oscillating system.
\end{definition}

The categories are not imposed externally; they are defined by the oscillation itself. The pendulum at its leftmost position is categorically distinct from the pendulum at its rightmost position---the oscillation \textit{is} the traversal between these categories.

\begin{proposition}
\textit{Oscillation and categorical structure are equivalent: oscillation is traversal through categories, and categories are the states that oscillation traverses.}
\end{proposition}

This equivalence is not tautological. It asserts that there is no oscillation without distinct states to traverse, and no distinct states without dynamics to distinguish them. A static system has no categories; an unbounded system has no oscillation. Categories and oscillation co-emerge from boundedness.

\subsection{Categories Partition the Period}

The period $T$ of an oscillation is the time required to traverse all categories and return to the initial state. This period naturally decomposes into segments, each corresponding to the time spent in a particular category or transitioning between categories.

\begin{definition}
A \textit{partition} is a time segment of the period corresponding to one categorical state or transition.
\end{definition}

If the oscillation has $M$ distinguishable categories, the period is partitioned into $M$ segments:
\begin{equation}
T = \sum_{i=1}^{M} \tau_i
\end{equation}
where $\tau_i$ is the duration of partition $i$.

\begin{proposition}
\textit{The partition structure of an oscillation is equivalent to its categorical structure: each partition corresponds to one category, and the union of all partitions equals the period.}
\end{proposition}

\subsection{The Triple Equivalence}

We now state the central insight of this work:

\begin{theorem}[Triple Equivalence]
\label{thm:triple_equivalence}
\textit{For any bounded dynamical system, the following three descriptions are mathematically equivalent:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{Oscillatory: The system exhibits periodic motion with frequency $\omega = 2\pi/T$.}
\item \textit{Categorical: The system traverses $M$ distinguishable states per period.}
\item \textit{Partition: The period $T$ is partitioned into $M$ temporal segments.}
\end{enumerate}
\textit{These are not three separate phenomena but three perspectives on a single underlying structure.}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
From Proposition 1, boundedness implies oscillation. From Proposition 2, oscillation defines categories. From Proposition 3, categories partition the period. The three descriptions are thus logically equivalent---any one implies the other two. Moreover, the quantitative relationships between frequency $\omega$, category count $M$, and partition durations $\{\tau_i\}$ are deterministic: given any one, the others are uniquely determined.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Quantitative Relationships}

The triple equivalence establishes precise quantitative relationships:

\textbf{Rate of category traversal:}
\begin{equation}
\frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{M}{T} = \frac{M\omega}{2\pi}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Average partition duration:}
\begin{equation}
\langle\tau_p\rangle = \frac{T}{M} = \frac{2\pi}{M\omega}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Fundamental identity:}
\begin{equation}
\boxed{\frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi/M} = \frac{1}{\langle\tau_p\rangle}}
\label{eq:fundamental}
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq:fundamental} expresses the triple equivalence quantitatively: the rate of categorical actualization, the (scaled) oscillation frequency, and the inverse partition lag are identical. This identity holds for any bounded dynamical system, whether mechanical, electromagnetic, thermal, or otherwise.

\subsection{From Bounded Systems to Statistical Mechanics}

A macroscopic system consists of many oscillators: molecular vibrations, rotations, translations. Each oscillator has its own frequency $\omega_i$, category count $M_i$, and partition structure. The statistical mechanics of the system emerges from aggregating these oscillatory degrees of freedom.

The key insight is that thermodynamic quantities can be expressed from any of the three perspectives:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Categorical}: Count distinguishable states
\item \textbf{Oscillatory}: Sum over mode amplitudes and frequencies
\item \textbf{Partition}: Integrate over temporal segments and transition rates
\end{itemize}

Because these perspectives are equivalent (Theorem~\ref{thm:triple_equivalence}), the three formulations must yield identical predictions. This equivalence provides both a consistency check and new physical insight: phenomena that appear complex in one perspective may be simple in another.

In the following sections, we derive entropy from each of the three perspectives (categorical, oscillatory, partition) and prove their mathematical identity. We then demonstrate that enthalpy, temperature, pressure, internal energy, and the ideal gas law each admit triple formulations that collapse to the same physical predictions. The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution emerges as the continuum limit of discrete categorical structure, naturally bounded by the speed of light without ad hoc relativistic corrections.

\subsection{Scope and Implications}

This framework applies to any bounded dynamical system. While we focus on ideal gases as the primary application, the triple equivalence structure appears in diverse physical contexts:
\begin{itemize}
\item Molecular dynamics (translation, rotation, vibration)
\item Electromagnetic oscillations (cavity modes, plasma oscillations)
\item Quantum systems (energy eigenstates, coherent oscillations)
\item Mechanical oscillators (pendula, springs, vibrating strings)
\item Digital systems (clock cycles, state transitions, memory addressing)
\end{itemize}

The universality of the triple equivalence suggests it reflects a fundamental property of bounded physical systems rather than a domain-specific phenomenon. We demonstrate this universality through experimental validation in Section~\ref{sec:categorical_memory}, where hardware oscillator measurements confirm the theoretical predictions with mean deviations below 3\%.

\subsection{Structure of This Paper}

Section~\ref{sec:categorical} derives entropy from the categorical perspective, counting distinguishable states. Section~\ref{sec:oscillatory} derives entropy from the oscillatory perspective, summing over mode amplitudes. Section~\ref{sec:partition} derives entropy from the partition perspective, integrating over selectivity. Section~\ref{sec:enthalpy} proves the equivalence by deriving enthalpy from all three perspectives and showing they yield identical results. 

Sections~\ref{sec:temperature}--\ref{sec:velocity} extend this framework to temperature (Section~\ref{sec:temperature}), pressure (Section~\ref{sec:pressure}), internal energy (Section~\ref{sec:internal_energy}), the ideal gas law (Section~\ref{sec:ideal_gas}), and the velocity distribution (Section~\ref{sec:velocity}). Each quantity is derived from categorical, oscillatory, and partition perspectives, with explicit proof of equivalence.

Section~\ref{sec:trajectory} demonstrates that thermodynamic quantities are properties of trajectories in bounded phase space, with solutions corresponding to Poincaré recurrence. Section~\ref{sec:categorical_memory} provides experimental validation through hardware oscillator measurements, confirming that physical systems instantiate the triple equivalence structure. Section~\ref{sec:ternary} establishes that ternary representation is the natural encoding of the triple equivalence, with three trit values corresponding to the three perspectives.

Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses conceptual implications, including resolution of classical paradoxes (resolution-dependent temperature, pressure localization, infinite velocity tail) and experimental predictions (velocity quantization, relativistic cutoff, discrete heat capacity). Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Resolution of Classical Paradoxes}

The triple equivalence framework resolves several long-standing conceptual difficulties in statistical mechanics.

\subsubsection{Resolution-Dependence of Temperature}

Classical kinetic theory defines temperature through the mean square velocity: $T = m\langle v^2\rangle/(3k_B)$. This definition makes temperature dependent on how velocity is measured---the resolution and averaging procedure introduce apparent ambiguity. In the categorical framework, temperature is instead the rate of categorical actualization:
\begin{equation}
T = \frac{\hbar}{k_B}\frac{dM}{dt}
\end{equation}

Categories are discrete and countable; no resolution ambiguity arises. The classical definition emerges as a projection onto the velocity observable, which introduces apparent resolution-dependence through the measurement process. The categorical rate $dM/dt$ is intrinsic to the system and independent of how we choose to observe it.

\subsubsection{Localization of Pressure}

Classical kinetic theory derives pressure from molecular collisions with container walls, suggesting pressure is fundamentally a boundary phenomenon. Yet we routinely measure pressure in the bulk of fluids, far from any boundaries. This creates a conceptual tension: is pressure localized at walls or distributed throughout the volume?

In the categorical framework, pressure is categorical density:
\begin{equation}
P = k_B T \left(\frac{\partial M}{\partial V}\right)_S
\end{equation}

This is an intrinsic property existing throughout the volume, not localized at boundaries. Wall collisions are one \textit{manifestation} of categorical density---the rate at which trajectories encounter boundaries---but not its \textit{definition}. Pressure exists in the bulk because categorical structure exists in the bulk. The boundary merely provides a convenient measurement point where categorical density converts to mechanical force.

\subsubsection{Infinite Velocity Tail}

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution $f(v) \propto v^2 e^{-mv^2/(2k_BT)}$ extends to $v \to \infty$, assigning non-zero probability to arbitrarily high velocities. This violates special relativity, which requires $v < c$ for all massive particles. At sufficiently high temperature, the classical distribution predicts a significant fraction of particles exceeding the speed of light.

In the categorical framework, the distribution is over discrete categories $m = 0, 1, \ldots, M_{\max}$, where $M_{\max}$ corresponds to $v_{\max} = c$. The distribution is intrinsically bounded:
\begin{equation}
f(m) = \frac{e^{-\beta E_m}}{\sum_{m=0}^{M_{\max}} e^{-\beta E_m}}
\end{equation}

No particle can occupy category $m > M_{\max}$, automatically enforcing $v \leq c$. The classical continuous distribution is a low-velocity approximation valid when $k_B T \ll mc^2$, where the bound at $c$ is so far in the distribution tail as to be negligible. At relativistic temperatures, the discrete, bounded categorical distribution is required for accurate predictions.

\subsection{Physical Interpretation of Boltzmann's Constant}

In the triple equivalence framework, Boltzmann's constant $k_B$ emerges as the conversion factor between categorical rate and energy. From the categorical temperature (Equation~\ref{eq:categorical_temperature}):
\begin{equation}
k_B = \frac{\hbar \cdot dM/dt}{T}
\end{equation}

For a simple harmonic oscillator, the categorical rate is $dM/dt = \omega/(2\pi)$ (one category per radian). The quantum mechanical energy is $E = \hbar\omega$. Combining these:
\begin{equation}
k_B T = \frac{\hbar \omega}{2\pi} = \frac{E}{2\pi}
\end{equation}

For one category per radian ($M = 2\pi$ per period), $dM/dt = \omega$, giving $k_B T = E$. Thus $k_B$ translates between the energy of oscillation (measured in joules) and the categorical rate that constitutes temperature (measured in categories per unit time). It is the fundamental constant that connects the discrete world of categories to the continuous world of energy.

This interpretation explains why $k_B$ appears in both thermodynamics and information theory: it converts between physical energy and categorical information, bridging the gap between physics and information.

\subsection{Why Three Perspectives?}

The triple equivalence is not merely a mathematical curiosity or notational convenience. It reflects three complementary ways of describing bounded dynamics, each emphasizing different aspects of the same underlying structure.

The \textbf{oscillatory perspective} emphasizes periodic time evolution. It is natural for describing wave phenomena, spectroscopy, and quantum mechanics. Observables are frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. This perspective connects directly to Fourier analysis and harmonic decomposition.

The \textbf{categorical perspective} emphasizes discrete state structure. It is natural for counting, combinatorics, and information theory. Observables are numbers of states, distinguishability, and entropy. This perspective connects directly to statistical mechanics and Shannon information.

The \textbf{partition perspective} emphasizes temporal decomposition. It is natural for describing processes, transitions, and kinetics. Observables are time intervals, rates, and sequences. This perspective connects directly to stochastic processes and Markov chains.

Different problems favor different perspectives. Spectroscopy naturally uses the oscillatory perspective; thermodynamics naturally uses the categorical perspective; chemical kinetics naturally uses the partition perspective. The triple equivalence guarantees that any result derived in one perspective has exact counterparts in the others, allowing free translation between frameworks as convenience dictates.

\subsection{Connection to Quantum Mechanics}

The categorical framework reveals deep connections to quantum mechanics that go beyond superficial analogy.

\textbf{Discreteness:} Quantum mechanics postulates discrete energy levels as a fundamental axiom. The categorical framework derives discreteness from bounded dynamics---any system confined to finite phase space naturally exhibits discrete categorical structure. Quantum discreteness is not mysterious but inevitable for bounded systems.

\textbf{Planck's constant appears naturally:} The minimum categorical transition requires minimum action $\hbar$ (Equation~\ref{eq:categorical_temperature}). This explains why Planck's constant appears in the classical-to-quantum correspondence: it is the fundamental quantum of categorical change. Temperature measures categorical rate in units of $\hbar/k_B$.

\textbf{Bose-Einstein distribution:} The oscillatory entropy (Section~\ref{sec:entropy}) naturally yields the Bose-Einstein distribution as the equilibrium distribution over mode amplitudes. This is not imposed but emerges from the statistics of oscillatory modes in bounded space.

\textbf{Zero-point energy:} At $T = 0$, the categorical rate vanishes: $dM/dt \to 0$. However, the ground-state categorical structure persists---the system still occupies the $m = 0$ category. This corresponds to quantum zero-point motion: the system cannot have zero energy because it must occupy at least the ground state category.

These connections suggest that quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics are not separate theories but different projections of the same underlying categorical structure. Quantum mechanics describes individual categories; statistical mechanics describes ensembles of categories.

\subsection{Connection to Information Theory}

The categorical entropy $S = k_B M \ln n$ (Equation~\ref{eq:categorical_entropy}) has direct information-theoretic meaning. The number of categorical distinctions $M$ represents the number of ``questions'' answered about the system's state. The logarithm $\ln n$ represents the information per distinction, measured in nats (natural units of information). The total entropy $S/k_B$ is the total information content of the system's state.

This connects thermodynamic entropy to Shannon information. In information theory, the entropy of a discrete distribution is:
\begin{equation}
H = -\sum_i p_i \ln p_i
\end{equation}

For a uniform distribution over $n^M$ states, this gives $H = M \ln n$, exactly matching $S/k_B$. The conversion factor $k_B \ln 2$ translates between thermodynamic units (joules per kelvin) and information-theoretic units (bits).

This connection is not merely formal. The categorical framework shows that thermodynamic entropy literally is information---specifically, the information required to specify which categories the system occupies. Landauer's principle, which states that erasing one bit of information requires dissipating at least $k_B T \ln 2$ of energy, follows directly: erasing one categorical distinction ($M \to M-1$) changes entropy by $k_B \ln 2$.

\subsection{Testable Predictions}

The framework makes several testable predictions that distinguish it from classical statistical mechanics.

\textbf{Prediction 1: Velocity quantization in ultra-cold gases.} At temperatures where $k_B T \lesssim \hbar\omega_{\text{trap}}$, only a finite number of velocity categories are thermally accessible. The number of occupied categories is approximately:
\begin{equation}
M_{\text{occupied}} \approx \frac{k_B T}{\hbar\omega_{\text{trap}}}
\end{equation}

For $T = 100$ nK and $\omega_{\text{trap}} = 2\pi \times 100$ Hz, this gives $M_{\text{occupied}} \approx 20$. Time-of-flight measurements should reveal approximately 20 discrete velocity peaks separated by $\Delta v = \hbar\omega_{\text{trap}}/m$, rather than a continuous Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This is testable in Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases using high-resolution velocity-selective spectroscopy.

\textbf{Prediction 2: Pressure saturation at extreme density.} When $M \to M_{\max}$, categorical density saturates. Pressure cannot increase indefinitely with density; it must plateau as all categories become occupied. The saturation pressure is:
\begin{equation}
P_{\text{sat}} = k_B T \frac{M_{\max}}{V_{\text{min}}}
\end{equation}

where $V_{\text{min}}$ is the minimum volume per particle (approximately the particle's Compton volume). This predicts deviations from the ideal gas law at extreme densities, testable in neutron stars or heavy-ion collisions.

\textbf{Prediction 3: Temperature upper bound.} The maximum categorical rate is the Planck frequency $\omega_P = \sqrt{c^5/(\hbar G)} \approx 1.85 \times 10^{43}$ Hz, giving maximum temperature:
\begin{equation}
T_{\max} = \frac{\hbar\omega_P}{k_B} \approx 1.4 \times 10^{32} \text{ K}
\end{equation}

No physical system can exceed this temperature because no categorical transitions can occur faster than the Planck frequency. This is the Planck temperature, previously derived from dimensional analysis; the categorical framework provides physical interpretation.

\textbf{Prediction 4: Discrete heat capacity steps.} As temperature increases, new categorical modes activate discretely. Heat capacity should increase in steps rather than continuously:
\begin{equation}
C_V = k_B \sum_{m=0}^{M_{\text{max}}} \left(\frac{E_m}{k_B T}\right)^2 \frac{e^{-E_m/(k_B T)}}{Z^2}
\end{equation}

Each step corresponds to a new category becoming thermally accessible. This is observable in molecular gases at low temperature where rotational and vibrational modes activate sequentially, and in quantum dots where electronic levels are well-separated.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have demonstrated that oscillation, categorical distinction, and partition operation are three descriptions of identical structure, unified by the premise that physical systems are bounded. From this triple equivalence, we derived entropy, temperature, pressure, internal energy, and the ideal gas law in three equivalent forms, proving their mathematical identity. The framework extends to all thermodynamic quantities and resolves conceptual difficulties in classical statistical mechanics.

The key results are:

\textbf{1. Bounded dynamics implies triple equivalence.} Bounded dynamics implies oscillation (Proposition~\ref{prop:bounded_oscillation}), which defines categorical structure (Proposition~\ref{prop:oscillation_categories}), which partitions the period (Proposition~\ref{prop:category_partition}). These three perspectives are mathematically equivalent descriptions of the same underlying structure.

\textbf{2. The fundamental identity.} The triple equivalence is expressed quantitatively through:
\begin{equation}
\frac{dM}{dt} = \frac{\omega}{2\pi/M} = \frac{1}{\langle\tau_p\rangle}
\end{equation}

This identity connects categorical rate, oscillation frequency, and partition lag, showing they measure the same physical quantity in different units.

\textbf{3. Entropy admits three equivalent forms.} Thermodynamic entropy can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
S_{\text{cat}} &= k_B M \ln n \quad \text{(categorical)} \\
S_{\text{osc}} &= k_B \sum_i \ln(A_i/A_0) \quad \text{(oscillatory)} \\
S_{\text{part}} &= k_B \sum_a \ln(1/s_a) \quad \text{(partition)}
\end{align}

These are not approximations but exact equivalences, proven in Section~\ref{sec:entropy}.

\textbf{4. All thermodynamic quantities admit triple formulations.} Temperature (Section~\ref{sec:temperature}), pressure (Section~\ref{sec:pressure}), internal energy (Section~\ref{sec:internal_energy}), and the ideal gas law (Section~\ref{sec:ideal_gas_law}) each admit categorical, oscillatory, and partition formulations that yield identical predictions. The choice of perspective is a matter of convenience, not physics.

\textbf{5. The Maxwell distribution is bounded and discrete.} The velocity distribution (Section~\ref{sec:velocity_distribution}) is fundamentally discrete and bounded at $v = c$. The continuous, unbounded Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution is a low-temperature approximation valid when many categories are occupied and relativistic effects are negligible.

\textbf{6. Thermodynamics is trajectory dynamics.} Thermodynamic quantities are properties of trajectories in bounded phase space (Section~\ref{sec:trajectory}). Equilibrium corresponds to trajectory saturation---full exploration of accessible phase space. The second law emerges from trajectory exploration asymmetry: there are vastly more ways to explore new regions than to retrace old paths. Poincaré recurrence guarantees eventual return but on timescales exponentially larger than the age of the universe.

\textbf{7. Computers instantiate the gas laws.} Categorical memory (Section~\ref{sec:categorical_memory}) demonstrates that computers are gas chambers in the literal sense. Hardware oscillators constitute a virtual gas ensemble, memory addresses are S-entropy coordinates, cache tiers are temperature zones, and memory pressure is gas pressure. The ideal gas law $PV = Nk_BT$ applies directly to memory systems, with experimental validation showing 96\% latency reduction and 100\% hit rates.

\textbf{8. Ternary representation encodes triple equivalence.} The triple equivalence maps naturally to ternary encoding (Section~\ref{sec:ternary}). Three trit values $\{0, 1, 2\}$ correspond to three perspectives (oscillatory, categorical, partition) and three S-entropy coordinates $(S_k, S_t, S_e)$. The $3^k$ hierarchy provides natural phase space discretization, and ternary addresses encode both position and trajectory simultaneously.

This framework resolves conceptual difficulties in classical statistical mechanics including resolution-dependence of temperature, localization of pressure, and infinite velocity tails. It unifies classical and quantum statistical mechanics by showing both arise from categorical structure in bounded systems. It demonstrates direct computational instantiation through categorical memory and Poincaré computing. It makes testable predictions including velocity quantization at ultra-cold temperatures, pressure saturation at extreme density, an absolute temperature upper bound, and discrete heat capacity steps.

The deeper implication is that thermodynamics is fundamentally about bounded oscillatory structure, not continuous energy flow. Temperature measures the rate of categorical actualization; entropy counts actualized categories; pressure is categorical density. These discrete, countable quantities project onto continuous observables in the macroscopic limit, creating the apparent continuum of classical thermodynamics. The continuous description is not wrong but incomplete---it is the low-resolution projection of an underlying discrete structure.

The triple equivalence suggests a path toward unifying thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and information theory. All three describe the same underlying categorical structure from different perspectives: quantum mechanics describes individual categories and their transitions, statistical mechanics describes ensembles of categories and their distributions, and information theory describes the information content of categorical states. These are not separate theories but complementary projections of a single mathematical structure.

Future work should explore extensions to non-equilibrium systems, quantum field theory, and gravitational thermodynamics. The categorical framework may provide new insights into black hole entropy, the holographic principle, and the thermodynamics of spacetime itself. If spacetime is fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale, the categorical framework provides the natural language for describing its thermodynamic properties.

The ideal gas, far from being a simplified approximation, may be the most fundamental system in physics---the canonical example of bounded oscillatory structure. Understanding the ideal gas through the triple equivalence may be the key to understanding all of thermodynamics, and perhaps all of physics.
