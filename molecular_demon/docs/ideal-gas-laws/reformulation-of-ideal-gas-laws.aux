(\textbf  {Diffusive: Partition Lag $\tau _p$}) The partition lag for diffusive transport spans an enormous range: 15 orders of magnitude from $10^1$ fs to $10^{16}$ fs. Vacancy jump (bright green curve) shows the longest lag times ($\tau _p \sim 10^{16}$ fs at 400 K)—vacancies are rare, so waiting for a vacancy to arrive takes enormous time. Interstitial diffusion (green curve) is faster ($\tau _p \sim 10^{13}$ fs)—interstitials are more mobile. Grain boundary diffusion (dark green curve) is much faster ($\tau _p \sim 10^9$ fs)—boundaries provide fast pathways. All mechanisms show exponential decrease with temperature: $\tau _p \propto \exp (\Phi /kT)$. This demonstrates that partition lag is the microscopic origin of diffusion barriers. (\textbf  {Thermal: Partition Lag $\tau _p$}) The partition lag for thermal transport varies with phonon frequency and scattering mechanism.

Impurity scattering (cyan curve) shows intermediate behavior. The dramatic difference between normal ($\tau _p \sim 10^3$ ps) and umklapp ($\tau _p \sim 10^2$ ps) explains why umklapp processes dominate thermal resistance at high temperature—they have shorter partition lag and thus higher scattering rate.

At high temperature ($T \gtrsim 10^{13}$ K), frequency saturates at Planck frequency (categorical bound). Classical prediction continues linearly (unphysical). \textbf {(C) Partition lag:} Average partition duration $\langle \tau _p\rangle $ (seconds, logarithmic scale 10$^{-23}$ to 10$^{-9}$) versus temperature $T$ (kelvin, logarithmic scale 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{13}$). Red solid line: partition lag decreases with temperature (inverse relationship). Text annotation at top left: ``Long lag (cold)'' indicates cold systems have long partition durations (slow categorical transitions). At $T = 10^{-3}$ K, $\langle \tau _p\rangle \sim 10^{-9}$ s. At $T = 10^{13}$ K, $\langle \tau _p\rangle \sim 10^{-23}$ s (approaching Planck time). \textbf {(D) Equivalence test:} Ratio to classical temperature (dimensionless) versus temperature $T$ (kelvin, logarithmic scale 10$^0$ to 10$^{10}$). Three overlapping traces: green circles (categorical), blue squares (oscillatory), red triangles (partition). All three traces overlap at ratio = 1.000 across entire temperature range, confirming triple equivalence. Vertical axis range: 0.900-1.100, showing deviations $<$0.1\% across 10 orders of magnitude in temperature}{figure.10}{}}
