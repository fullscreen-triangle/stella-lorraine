    "Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions overlap completely",
    "Same velocity has different meaning in different ensembles",
    "A 500 m/s molecule is \"fast\" in cold, \"slow\" in hot",
    "Temperature is not a molecular property",
    "Only ensembles have temperature",
    "Sorting by velocity does not sort by temperature",
    "Category changes on transfer (fast -> slow)",
    "Demon achieves opposite of intention for overlap molecules",
    "The overlap region includes ALL velocities",
    "Temperature contribution depends on destination, not source"
