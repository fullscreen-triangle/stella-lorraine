\textbf{(A)} Negation field map for hydrogen ($Z=1$) showing the potential $\phi(r) = -1/r$ (color) and field lines (white arrows) in the $xy$-plane. The field diverges at the origin (nucleus) and decreases as $1/r^2$. Color scale from dark red (strong binding, $\phi \approx -9$ at $r = 0.1$ Bohr) to dark blue (weak binding, $\phi \approx 0$ at $r = 5$ Bohr). Field lines are radial, reflecting spherical symmetry. The $1s$ partition boundary (not shown) lies at $\langle r \rangle = 1.5$ Bohr where the radial probability peaks.
\textbf{(B)} Negation field map for carbon ($Z=6$) showing $\phi(r) = -6/r$ with stronger binding (darker red near nucleus). Multiple shells are evident from the color gradient: inner shell ($1s$, $r \sim 0.1$ Bohr), middle shell ($2s$, $r \sim 0.5$ Bohr), outer shell ($2p$, $r \sim 1$ Bohr). Field lines remain radial but the effective potential seen by outer electrons is screened by inner electrons.
\textbf{(C)} Radial probability distributions $|\psi_{nl}(r)|^2 r^2$ for the first four atomic orbitals. Blue: $1s$ ($n=1, l=0$) peaks at $r = 1$ Bohr; green: $2s$ ($n=2, l=0$) has two peaks with node at $r = 2$ Bohr; orange: $2p$ ($n=2, l=1$) peaks at $r = 4$ Bohr; red: $3s$ ($n=3, l=0$) has three peaks with nodes at $r = 1.9$ and $7.1$ Bohr. The number of radial nodes equals $n - l - 1$, consistent with partition coordinate structure. Peak positions scale approximately as $n^2$.

Black curve: potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2$. Colored curves: probability densities for $\nu = 0$ (blue), $\nu = 1$ (orange), $\nu = 2$ (green), $\nu = 3$ (red). Shaded regions indicate classically allowed zones. Higher modes have more nodes and extend further into classically forbidden regions. This illustrates the general principle: partition coordinate $n$ corresponds to number of nodes in the wave function.
\textbf{(E)} Infrared absorption spectrum showing partition oscillations. Transmittance vs. wavenumber for a typical organic molecule. Sharp absorption dips correspond to vibrational transitions: O-H stretch (3500 cm$^{-1}$), C-H stretch (3000 cm$^{-1}$), C=O stretch (1700 cm$^{-1}$), C-O stretch (1000 cm$^{-1}$). Each absorption measures a transition between vibrational partition coordinates $\nu \to \nu + 1$. The spectrum is a fingerprint of the molecular structure.

Red spheres: current positions. Yellow lines: trajectory paths connecting start to current state. Gray grid: phase space structure. Computation is literally a trajectory through bounded phase space—not a metaphor but an identity.
\textbf{Top Center - Computational velocity equals Maxwell distribution:} Probability density versus step velocity $|\Delta x|$ (range 0.00-0.20). Blue histogram: computational velocity distribution (derived from trajectory step sizes). Red dashed curve: Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (not assumed, but emerges naturally). Perfect agreement demonstrates that computational step statistics automatically yield thermodynamic velocity distribution. No statistical mechanics assumptions required—Maxwell distribution is a theorem about bounded computation.
\textbf{Top Right - Temperature from trajectory spread:} Derived temperature (kelvin, scale $\times 10^{43}$, range 1.55-1.95) versus trajectory spread $\sigma$ (range 0.20-0.34). Orange circles: computed temperature from trajectory statistics. Red dashed line: linear fit with slope $\approx 6.1 \times 10^{52}$ K. Temperature is defined as $T = f(\sigma)$ where $\sigma$ measures phase space exploration. Scatter around fit line shows thermal fluctuations. This derivation defines temperature from computation, not from energy.
\textbf{Middle Left - Boundary collisions equal pressure:} Three-dimensional heat map showing boundary collision density. Axes: $x$, $y$ (both range 0.0-1.0), vertical axis shows hit density (0.0-1.0). Color gradient: gray (low density) to yellow (high density, $\sim$1.0). Red regions at boundaries show high collision rate. Pressure is literally the boundary hit rate: $P = (\text{boundary collisions})/(\text{area} \times \text{time})$. No force concept needed—pressure emerges from trajectory statistics.
\textbf{Middle Center - Entropy increases then saturates:} Entropy $S = \ln(\Omega)$ (dimensionless, range 3-8) versus computation steps (0-300).

Red dashed horizontal line at $S_{\max} = \ln(V/\delta V) \approx 8$: maximum entropy (complete phase space exploration).

Green solid line: categorical prediction (linear on log-log plot). Four colored background regions: purple (quantum regime, $T < 1$ K), light green (classical regime, 1 K $< T < 10^7$ K), light orange (relativistic regime, $T > 10^7$ K). Temperature measures the rate at which categories are actualized: $T = (\hbar/k_B) \cdot dM/dt$.
\textbf{(B) Oscillatory frequency:} Angular frequency $\omega$ (rad/s, logarithmic scale 10$^8$ to 10$^{48}$) versus temperature $T$ (kelvin, logarithmic scale 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{13}$). Blue solid line: categorical prediction. Gray dashed line: classical (no bound, linear). Purple dotted horizontal line at $\omega_{\text{Planck}} = 1.85 \times 10^{43}$ rad/s: maximum frequency (Planck frequency). At low temperature, frequency scales linearly with $T$. At high temperature ($T \gtrsim 10^{13}$ K), frequency saturates at Planck frequency (categorical bound). Classical prediction continues linearly (unphysical).
\textbf{(C) Partition lag:} Average partition duration $\langle\tau_p\rangle$ (seconds, logarithmic scale 10$^{-23}$ to 10$^{-9}$) versus temperature $T$ (kelvin, logarithmic scale 10$^{-3}$ to 10$^{13}$). Red solid line: partition lag decreases with temperature (inverse relationship). Text annotation at top left: ``Long lag (cold)'' indicates cold systems have long partition durations (slow categorical transitions). At $T = 10^{-3}$ K, $\langle\tau_p\rangle \sim 10^{-9}$ s.

\textbf{(A) Room temperature ($T = 300$ K):} Probability density $f(v)$ versus velocity $v$ (m/s, range 0-1400). Black solid curve: classical Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (continuous, smooth bell curve with peak at $v \approx 200$ m/s). Green bars: categorical distribution (discrete histogram with $\sim$30 categories). Inset shows high-velocity tail (500-700 m/s): classical tail extends smoothly, categorical shows discrete steps with decreasing probability. Categorical distribution is intrinsically discrete and bounded, approximating Maxwell-Boltzmann at low velocity but showing discrete structure at high velocity.
\textbf{(B) Ultra-cold ($T = 1$ mK):} Probability $f(m)$ versus category index $m$ (range 0-14). Green bars show discrete categorical distribution with strong peak at $m = 0$ (probability $\approx 0.27$) and exponential decay for $m > 0$. Text annotation: ``$\Delta v = 215.06$ mm/s'' indicates velocity spacing between categories. At ultra-cold temperature, only a few categories are thermally accessible ($M_{\text{occupied}} \approx 10$), making discrete structure directly observable. This predicts velocity quantization in ultra-cold atomic gases.
\textbf{(C) Relativistic ($T = 10^9$ K):} Probability density (logarithmic scale, 10$^{-6}$ to 10$^0$) versus $v/c$ (fraction of speed of light, range 0.0-1.2). Black dashed line: classical Maxwell-Boltzmann (unphysical, extends beyond $c$). Green solid line: categorical distribution (bounded at $v = c$). Pink shaded region ($v > c$): forbidden zone. Classical distribution assigns non-zero probability to $v > c$ (violates special relativity). Categorical distribution goes to zero at $v = c$ (automatically enforces relativistic bound). Red dotted vertical line at $v/c = 1.0$ marks light speed barrier.
\textbf{(D) Oscillatory distribution:} Occupation number $\langle n \rangle$ (logarithmic scale, 10$^{-10}$ to 10$^4$) versus frequency $\omega$ (rad/s, logarithmic scale 10$^{10}$ to 10$^{15}$). Green circles connected by lines: categorical oscillatory distribution. Text annotation: ``Perfect agreement'' and ``Categorical Bose-Einstein.'' Distribution follows Bose-Einstein form $\langle n \rangle = 1/(e^{\hbar\omega/(k_BT)} - 1)$, showing exponential decay from $\langle n \rangle \sim 10^4$ at low frequency to $\langle n \rangle \sim 10^{-10}$ at high frequency.
