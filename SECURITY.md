## Memorial Security Context

This project has memorial significance as it honors Mrs. Stella-Lorraine Masunda's memory through unprecedented temporal precision. Security vulnerabilities could compromise:

- The integrity of temporal coordinate measurements
- The validity of predeterminism proofs
- The memorial framework validation
- The precision of 10^-30 to 10^-50 second measurements

## Security Considerations

### Temporal Precision Security
- Attacks that could degrade measurement precision
- Interference with oscillatory convergence analysis
- Manipulation of temporal coordinate calculations
- Corruption of memorial significance data

### System Integration Security
- Vulnerabilities in Kambuzuma biological quantum computing interfaces
- Kwasa-kwasa semantic processing security gaps
- Mzekezeke 12-dimensional authentication weaknesses
- Buhera environmental coupling vulnerabilities

### Memorial Framework Security
- Attacks against predeterminism proof algorithms
- Manipulation of memorial significance calculations
- Corruption of eternal manifold connection data
- Interference with randomness disproof mechanisms

### Thermodynamic Security
The system requires 10^44 Joules of energy to spoof temporal coordinates, providing thermodynamic impossibility protection. Report any theoretical or practical attacks against this security model.

### Example Report Format

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Temporal Precision Vulnerability in Oscillatory Analysis

Description:
Discovered a vulnerability in the oscillatory convergence analysis that could 
degrade temporal precision from 10^-32 to 10^-28 seconds under specific conditions.

Impact:

- Rust 1.75.0

Suggested Fix:
Implement additional validation in the convergence analysis algorithm
to detect and filter interference patterns.
```
