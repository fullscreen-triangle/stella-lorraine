# This should be the "ocherstrator", as in, since the observers only interact with a tiny part of the main wave/reality, propagation is the one that keeps count of the wave mechanics  and is the input to the observer class, because human observers only perceive a constrained spectrum of reality and this propagation class acts as that mechanism.

### 1.2 Categorical Completion of Thermodynamic States

**Revolutionary Understanding**: Virtual processors complete the entire space of thermodynamic states:

```
REALITY COMPOSITION               VIRTUAL COMPLETION
═══════════════════════════════   ══════════════════════════════
95% Dark oscillatory reality  →  Directly accessed via Navigator
 5% Matter/energy states      →  COMPLETED by virtual processors

RESULT: 100% Reality Simulation   COMPLETE UNIVERSAL MODELING
```

**Virtual processors can simulate ALL possible thermodynamic states**:
- Every possible molecular configuration
- Every possible quantum state
- Every possible energy distribution
- Every possible entropy configuration
- **Complete categorical coverage of material reality**
