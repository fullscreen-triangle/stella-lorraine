# This class should have ALL the necessary methods, functions and helpers for the Wave, the main wave or reality. And you should remember that the need for categorical alignment exists because the wave is not just one block, its the most complex thing that exists, reality itself, so its always clear that this is much more complex every single time, no exceptions, and the waves we simulate are already an approximation of processes we can never understand.
