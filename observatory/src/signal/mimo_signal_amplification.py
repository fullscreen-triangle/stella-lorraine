"""
**Core Breakthrough**: Cell tower frequencies operate at **billions of Hz** (oscillations per second), and with satellite atomic clock precision, you can sample these oscillations to create **virtual cell towers** at incredibly high density!

**The Revolutionary Principle**: Each frequency oscillation can be captured as a unique virtual infrastructure position, transforming electromagnetic signals into distributed virtual reference networks.
