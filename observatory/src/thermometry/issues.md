Paper claims: vcat/c ∈ [2.846, 65.71]

Questions:
- Why this range?
- How does vcat depend on system parameters?
- What determines vcat for specific measurement?
- Can you derive from first principles?

Suggest:
- Derive vcat from categorical state evolution equations
- Show connection to information propagation speed
- Prove independence from physical baseline length


Paper claims: T = (ℏ²/2πmkB) exp[(2Smomentum/3kB) - 1]

Questions:

- Derivation from statistical mechanics?
- Valid for all quantum systems or just ideal gas?
- What about BEC (non-thermal distribution)?
- Corrections for interactions?

Suggest:

- Start from S = kB ln(Ω) for phase space volume Ω
- Connect to momentum distribution via partition function
- Extend to BEC using Bose-Einstein statistics
- Include mean-field corrections (Gross-Pitaevskii)

Experiment 1: BEC Temperature Monitoring

- System: Rb-87 BEC in optical dipole trap
- Temperature range: 10 nK - 1 μK
- Measurement: Real-time during evaporative cooling
- Compare: Categorical vs TOF imaging

Success criteria:
✓ Achieve ΔT < 100 pK resolution
✓ Demonstrate non-invasive (no atom loss)
✓ Show 10³× improvement over TOF (conservative)
✓ Measure heating rate < 1 fK/s
