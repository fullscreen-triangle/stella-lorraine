# Reference Corrections - Publication-Ready Bibliography

## Problem Identified

The original paper included 8 citations to "Manuscript in preparation" papers that don't exist yet. This would immediately disqualify the paper from any peer review process.

**Removed unpublished references:**
1. `sachikonye2024categorical_topology`
2. `sachikonye2024gibbs`
3. `sachikonye2024stellas`
4. `sachikonye2024perception`
5. `sachikonye2024hardware_spectroscopy`
6. `sachikonye2024hardware_cv`
7. `sachikonye2024semiconductors`

## Solution: Replaced with Established Literature

All concepts are now supported by legitimate published work spanning multiple decades of research.

## Synthesis Strategy

Rather than citing non-existent papers, the current version:

1. **Synthesizes ideas directly** - Hardware oscillation harvesting concepts are presented as novel synthesis of established principles (synchronization + hardware timing + quantum biology)

2. **Builds on solid foundations** - Each major claim traces back to recognized work

3. **Makes original contributions** - The *combination* and *application* to gas mechanics is novel, but the components are all well-established

4. **Proper attribution** - Ideas like:
   - Oscillator synchronization → Huygens, Pikovsky, Strogatz
   - Information catalysis → Landauer, Bennett, Mizraji
   - Biological coherence → Engel, Lambert
   - Hardware timing → Intel, Linux, Microsoft, Apple docs

5. **Novel synthesis claim** - The paper's contribution is showing how these established principles combine to enable hardware oscillation harvesting for molecular gas analysis

## Publication Strategy Recommendation

Given the now solid bibliography, recommend targeting:

**First-tier options:**
1. **Physical Review Letters** (if kept under 4 pages with tight focus on hardware harvesting)
2. **Physical Review E** (full technical development)
3. **Chaos** (emphasis on synchronization and nonlinear dynamics)

**Interdisciplinary options:**
4. **Nature Communications** (broad impact, hardware innovation angle)
5. **PNAS** (computational-physical interface)

**Specialized options:**
6. **Journal of Chemical Physics** (gas mechanics focus)
7. **IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological, and Multi-Scale Communications**

All now viable with proper published references supporting every major claim.
