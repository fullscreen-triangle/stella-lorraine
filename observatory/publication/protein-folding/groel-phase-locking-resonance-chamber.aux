Green box: ``SOLUTION: Categorical observation (zero cost).''

Yellow box: ``PROBLEM: Measurement costs energy (Landauer).'' \textit {Right (Proton Demon):} Proton (H$^+$, yellow circle) oscillates in 40 THz field between donor (D, red circle) and acceptor (A, blue circle). Green box: ``SOLUTION: Categorical observation (zero cost).'' Key difference box: Classical demon measures continuous speeds (costs energy); proton demon observes discrete states (bond exists/doesn't exist, zero cost). No continuous measurement needed. \textbf {(B)} Categorical state space exclusion showing exponential pathway reduction. Top bar shows total configuration space: 10$^{129}$ states. Red region (left, large) shows states excluded by categorical observation (bonds that can't form). Green region (right, small) shows allowed states (correct folds). Decision tree (bottom): Bond 1 forms? If NO → exclude 10$^{64}$ states (red branch). If YES → continue with 10$^{65}$ states (green branch). Bond 2 forms? If NO → exclude further states. If YES → continue for all N bonds. Blue box explains exponential exclusion: each bond decision excludes $\sim $half of remaining states; after N bonds, only 1 pathway remains. Information cost: 0 (categorical observation). Time cost: O(N), not O(10$^{129}$). \textbf {(C)} Proton demon phase-locking mechanism showing nested electromagnetic resonances. Time series (0 to 4$\pi $) of field amplitude (y-axis, $-$1.5 to +1.5). Purple oscillations: H$^+$ field at 40 THz (highest frequency). Pink oscillations: O$_2$ modulation at 10 THz (medium frequency). Yellow envelope: GroEL cavity at 1 Hz ATP cycle (lowest frequency). Green shaded regions mark phase-locked windows where all three fields align. Pink shaded regions mark phase-slip windows where fields misalign. Black curve shows proton demon response: high amplitude during phase-lock (green), low amplitude during phase-slip (pink). Legend shows field hierarchy. This demonstrates nested frequency coupling: 40 THz H$^+$ → 10 THz O$_2$ → 1 Hz GroEL, enabling trans-Planckian information transfer. \textbf {(D)} Information flow and energy cost showing advantage of categorical observation. \textit {Left (Information Flow):} Orange box: O$_2$ quantum states (25,110 states, 10 THz) at top.

Green box: GroEL cavity demodulator (1 Hz ATP cycle) at bottom. Black arrows show information flow downward. \textit {Right (Energy Cost Analysis):} Pink box: Traditional measurement costs k$_B$T ln(2) per bit (Landauer limit). Green box: Categorical observation costs 0 (zero cost!). Yellow box: ADVANTAGE: $\infty $ efficiency gain! This demonstrates that categorical observation bypasses Landauer limit by observing discrete states rather than continuous variables. \textbf {Key Insights (bottom):} 1.

Yellow box highlights \textbf {KEY INSIGHT: Last bonds to break = First to form!} This reverses the folding pathway: bonds that stabilize the native state most strongly (last to break) must form early to nucleate folding. \textbf {(B)} H-bond formation timeline showing 10 bonds (y-axis, Bond ID 1-10) forming across 10 cycles (x-axis). Circle size represents bond strength. Color indicates criticality (colorbar 0.65-0.95): dark red = high criticality (forms early, essential for nucleation), yellow = medium criticality, white = low criticality (forms late, stabilizes structure). Dashed gray lines connect consecutive formation events. Bonds 1, 2 form earliest (cycles 1-3, dark red, criticality 0.90-0.95), establishing folding nucleus. Bonds 6-10 form later (cycles 6-10, yellow-white, criticality 0.70-0.85), completing structure. This temporal ordering reveals the folding pathway. \textbf {(C)} Folding nucleus core bonds showing three critical bonds ranked by phase-lock quality (x-axis, 0.0-1.0). Bond 6 (C5, red bar) has highest quality 1.0. Bond 2 (C1, red bar) has quality $\sim $0.95. Bond 1 (C1, salmon bar) has quality $\sim $0.90. These three bonds form the folding nucleus: they phase-lock first (high criticality in panel B) and maintain highest coherence (high quality). Labels C5, C1 indicate formation cycles. The folding nucleus acts as template for subsequent bond formation. \textbf {(D)} H-bond network topology showing folding nucleus at center. Seven nodes (blue circles numbered 1-7) represent hydrogen bonds. Gray edges show coupling between bonds. Network has star-like topology: central node 2 connects to nodes 1, 4, 6. Node 6 connects to nodes 1, 3, 5, 7. This topology explains folding mechanism: nucleus bonds (1, 2, 6) form first and couple strongly, then peripheral bonds (3, 4, 5, 7) phase-lock to nucleus through network coupling. The centralized topology ensures cooperative folding once nucleus establishes. This reverse algorithm solves the forward folding problem by exploiting temporal causality: the native structure encodes its own folding pathway through bond stability hierarchy}{figure.caption.10}{}}

Red line shows saturation kinetics: folding rate increases from 0.1 (0 μM) to 0.8 (200 μM) following Michaelis-Menten-like curve. Prediction: folding rate $\propto $ [O$_2$], saturating at $\sim $200 μM when all GroEL cavities are O$_2$-saturated. This tests the hypothesis that cytoplasmic O$_2$ provides the master clock frequency. \textbf  {(B)} Crowding independence prediction showing folding rate remains constant ($\sim $0.80 rel.) despite increasing crowding agent concentration (0-400 mg/ml). Green line shows slight fluctuation (0.74-0.84) but no systematic trend. Gray dashed line at 0.80 marks baseline. Prediction: folding rate $\neq  $ f(crowding), unlike spontaneous folding which slows dramatically with crowding. This demonstrates that GroEL-mediated folding operates through active phase-locking, not passive confinement. \textbf  {(C)} Isotope effect prediction showing deuterium oxide (D$_2$O) slows folding.
