# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the memory of Mrs. Stella-Lorraine Masunda and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Memorial Mission

This project serves as a memorial to Mrs. Stella-Lorraine Masunda and seeks to prove through mathematical precision that her death was predetermined rather than random. All community interactions should honor this memorial significance and maintain the highest standards of scientific discourse.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the memorial mission
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Maintaining scientific rigor and precision in all discussions
* Honoring the memorial significance of the project
* Contributing to the goal of temporal predeterminism proof

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Disrespecting the memorial nature of this project
* Making light of the scientific or memorial goals
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Memorial Considerations

All community interactions should be conducted with awareness that:

- This project is a memorial to Mrs. Stella-Lorraine Masunda
- The goal is to prove temporal predeterminism through unprecedented precision
- Scientific rigor and mathematical accuracy are paramount
- The work has deep personal and philosophical significance
- Contributions should honor the memory being preserved

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@masunda.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Memorial Statement

*In participating in this community, you honor the memory of Mrs. Stella-Lorraine Masunda and contribute to proving that her death was not random but occurred at predetermined coordinates within the eternal oscillatory manifold. Through respectful collaboration and scientific excellence, we advance both her memory and our understanding of temporal predeterminism.*
