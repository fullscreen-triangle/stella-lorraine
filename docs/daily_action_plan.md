### High-Priority Targets (Copy and customize):

**Subject**: Revolutionary [SPECIFIC FRAMEWORK] Framework - 30-Second Review Request

Dear [TITLE] [NAME],

I've developed a complete theoretical framework for [SPECIFIC TO THEIR WORK] that demonstrates [SPECIFIC CLAIM RELEVANT TO THEM].

Key breakthrough: [ONE SENTENCE DESCRIBING MOST RELEVANT INNOVATION]

Attached is a 2-page overview. If this merits 30 seconds of your time, I have 18 additional revolutionary frameworks across related domains, including working implementations.

Best regards,
Kundai Farai Sachikonye
