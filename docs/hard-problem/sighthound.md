## Mathematical Framework

### Dynamic Kalman Filtering

**State Prediction:**
```math
x_k = F \cdot x_{k-1} + w
P_k = F \cdot P_{k-1} \cdot F^T + Q
```

**Measurement Update:**
```math
y_k = z_k - H \cdot x_k
K_k = P_k \cdot H^T \cdot (H \cdot P_k \cdot H^T + R)^{-1}
x_k = x_k + K_k \cdot y_k
P_k = (I - K_k \cdot H) \cdot P_k
```

Where:
- `x_k`: State vector (position, velocity)
- `F`: State transition matrix
- `P_k`: Error covariance matrix
- `Q`: Process noise covariance
- `R`: Measurement noise covariance

### Weighted Triangulation

**Position Estimation:**
```math
\text{Latitude} = \frac{\sum (\text{Latitude}_i \cdot w_i)}{\sum w_i}
\text{Longitude} = \frac{\sum (\text{Longitude}_i \cdot w_i)}{\sum w_i}
```

Where: `w_i = 1/\text{Signal Strength}_i`

### Bayesian Evidence Networks

The system implements fuzzy Bayesian networks where each node maintains belief distributions updated through fuzzy evidence propagation. The objective function optimizes:

- Trajectory smoothness
- Evidence consistency
- Confidence maximization
- Uncertainty minimization
- Temporal coherence

## Consciousness-Aware Reasoning Integration

### Autobahn Integration

The system delegates complex probabilistic reasoning to the Autobahn consciousness-aware bio-metabolic reasoning engine, implementing:

**Consciousness Metrics:**
- Integrated Information Theory (IIT) Φ calculation
- Global workspace activation
- Self-awareness scoring
- Metacognition assessment

**Biological Intelligence:**
- Membrane coherence optimization
- Ion channel efficiency
- ATP metabolic mode selection
- Fire-light coupling at 650nm

**Threat Assessment:**
- Biological immune system modeling
- T-cell and B-cell response simulation
- Coherence interference detection
- Adversarial pattern recognition

## Performance Characteristics

| Triangulation | O(n log n) | O(n) |
| Bayesian Update | O(n²) | O(n) |
| Path Optimization | O(n³) | O(n²) |

### Accuracy Metrics

**Position Accuracy (RMSE):**
```math
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (p_{true} - p_{est})^2}
```

**Confidence Correlation:**
```math
r = \frac{\sum (C - \bar{C})(E - \bar{E})}{\sqrt{\sum(C - \bar{C})^2 \sum(E - \bar{E})^2}}
```
